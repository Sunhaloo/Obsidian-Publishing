# Definitions

>[!tip]- Definition
>- Hardware:
>	- It is the **tangible** part of the computer
>		- Example:
>			- Case, Motherboard, Disks, Graphics Cards
>- CPU:
>	- Central Processing Unit; the "*brains*" of the computer
>		- Performs all calculations and logic and execution of programs
>- Main Memory:
>	- Primary / Main memory is a type of memory that is constantly and directly being accessed by the CPU
>		- Stores data temporarily / Volatile
>- Secondary Memory:
>	- Type of memory that is external and used to stored data.
>		- Data is **not** lost after shutdown / Non-Volatile
>- Input Device:
>	- Any devices that are used to enter data into the computer
>		- Example:
>			- Mouse, Keyboard
>			- Steering Wheel
>			- Graphic Tablet / Pad
>			- Scanner
>- Output Device:
>	- After entering data, the CPU will process and the using *output* devices; will output the information to the user
>		- Example:
>			- Monitor
>			- Speaker
>			- Printer
>- Software:
>	- It is the **intangible** programs and [[Data and Information | data]] that runs on the computer *hardware*
>		- Examples of Software:
>			- System Software: BIOS, Operating System
>			- Application Software: runs on the OS; programs, etc
>			- Utility Software: Disk Defragmenter, Firewall, Anti-Virus
>- Programs:
>	- Set of instructions written in a programming language for a computer to execute
