# Terminal / Bash

I consider this my home. Unlike most people that use a GUI / mouse to navigate around the computer; I use only the keyboard to do most things from the Terminal / Command Line like in the golden old days.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux ( WSL )

Because I play games and University requires programs like Microsoft Access; I still need to be able to use Windows.
Hence, WSL! It provides you with a Bash / Linux environment in Windows. Think of it having a Linux Command Line without any Virtual Machines.

I do most things from the command line, like:

- Downloading Applications ( with package managers such as `apt`, `pacman` or `scoop` for Windows )
	- I can download GUI apps or even CLI apps like compilers and more. ( *screenshot below $\downarrow$ is with Powershell* )
	- ![[Scoop Package Manager Applications.png]]
- Create / Move files or Folder
- Code; yes Coding is possible using Text Editors like Vim ( *I use Vim BTW* $\leftarrow$ If you use vim, you need to say this line )
- Running Servers / SSH
- Git / Git Bash / GitHub - Version Control
	- Cloning, Committing and Pushing

# Vim / Neovim

Vi was a text editor create by Bill Joy and was later improved by Bram Moolenaar; where he named it ViM ( Vi Improved ). It was / is an open source project. Now, in the modern day we use Neovim which is a fork of Vim. It is highly customisable ( uses Lua as "*backend*" ) and people can use it to create Personal Development Environment ( PDE *not IDE* ). It has a great community that is actively working on plugins like Language Server Protocols ( LSPs ), Treesitter ( used for Syntax Highlighting ), etc.

I was introduced to Vim / Neovim when I came across a video by [devaslife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) and [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen).

This is why I hate using other IDE like NetBeans, Visual Studio because its **slow** and **bloated** with things that you probably don't need and also lack of Vim Emulation; working with a mouse will **slow** you down; use the keyboard only!!!

In VS Code; we do have extension that is highly customisable like in Neovim but just in `.json` files. While Netbeans and IntelliJ does have Vim Emulation, its not as easy as the former.

As I "*live*" in the Terminal ( Bash / Powershell ); I need to be able to edit all type of files and code without leaving my PDE.

>My whole Neovim configuration ( *which is found at https://www.github.com/Sunhaloo/MyNeovim* ) is in Kilobytes compared to Visual Studio requiring Gigabytes.

## Editing Code in Neovim

# Markdown and Obsidian

## Markdown

Instead of using Word documents / MS Word to write documents; I use Markdown, because this is what actual Software Engineers / Programmers use to document and communicate on GitHub / Companies.
Its portable, meaning even if the world goes down and every program goes down except a simple text file viewer. I will still be able to access and continue to write my notes.

## Obsidian

Now, what is this "*Obsidian*" thing? If you are into Personal Knowledge Management ( PKM ); then you will have heard of Obsidian. Its a *renderer* for Markdown ( *you can also use VS Code to preview Markdown files* ). This is where I write everything; basically this is my Second Brain now, if I do not have this, then I am lost! Even now, I am using it to write this very text.

![[Obsidian Markdown.png]]

With this program; I have made countless of documentations for Python, C and Windows and even installing Arch; they might not be perfect but I made them. I use Git / GitHub to backup and track my notes and even host my notes on the Internet using Netlify; here is the link: https://sunhaloolearns.netlify.app/.

>It even has Vim Emulation!!!
>![[Obsidian Vim Emulation.png]]

I feel that the Education system in Mauritius needs to be changed / improved; so that people know about things like Obsidian, Notion, PARA system and more.... The brain does not store information in an A4 paper organised in a File Cabinet!

# Virtual Machines

# Virtual Box

>I do not really know how to use QEMU!

Like I said; I like Bash and Linux. There are somethings that can only be done on Linux. For example, if you want to only use your keyboard ( *from starting the computer to shutdown* ) to navigate through your system, then use a Window Manager like i3 or HyprLand. These are \*only available on Linux.

>Yes, I know GlazeWM and Komorebi exists on Windows.
>I use GlazeWM on Windows!

As I said; because I cannot commit to Linux full-time ( *because playing games and using programs like Access* ); I use Virtual Box $\downarrow$

![[Virtual Box.png]]

Here I can even crash `sudo rm -rf /` the Virtual System without any problem as I can re-install it without loosing any of my data / work.

# Open Broadcasting Software ( OBS )

I use OBS to record and stream my desktop to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMkQZsuW6eHMhdUObLPSpwg). Here is how it looks like:
