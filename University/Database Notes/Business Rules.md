# What is a Business Rule?

>This is related to [[Entity Relationship Diagram ( ERD ) and Relationships#Sample E-R Diagram | ERDs]]

>[!note]-
>This is not really related to actual Database like SQL, Access or other.
>Because the module is called "*Database Design*"; we need to learn how to make a company become "*digital*".

It defines or constrains some aspect of a business. It also guide everyday **decision-making** within businesses by outlining **relationships** between objects.

>[!tip] Teacher's Notes
>- Statements that define / constrains some aspect of business
>- Assert business structure
>- Control / Influence business behaviour
>- Expressed in terms familiar to end users
>- Automated through [[Database Management System ( DBMS ) | DBMS]] software.

>[!info]
>If you Google "*What is Business Rule in Database*"; you are going to get something like this:
>"*Server-side logic that execute when database records are queried, updated, inserted or deleted.*"
>>I don't really know what's going on.

>The notes below $\downarrow$ are from Teacher; just copying them from the Lecture Slide ( *Page 11 - Week 3 - Modelling Data in Organisations* ), because I do not know how to classify them.

- Declarative ( "*What*", **not** "*How*" )
- Precise ( *Clear / Agreed-Upon Meaning* )
- Atomic ( *1 Statement* )
- Consistent ( *Internally / Externally* )
- Expressible ( *Structured, Natural Language* )
- Distinct ( *Non-Redundant* )
- Business-Oriented ( *Understood by Business People* )
