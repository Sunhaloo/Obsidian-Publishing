# Analysis Phase

## Introduction

Established on June 15, 1995, by James May, Sun's Systems is a reliable and customer-focused company in the computer hardware industry. Located at Place D'Armes, the company attracts many customers and tourists with its extensive product range and exceptional service.
Sun's Systems has built a solid reputation for providing a variety of computer products and spare parts. The company offers an array of desktops and essential computer components like motherboards, processors, graphics cards, and storage devices, catering to diverse customer needs.
Additionally, Sun's Systems provides services such as building custom computers for professionals and gamers, as well as expert computer repair and convenient delivery services. These services have further cemented the company's position as a trusted provider in the industry.
As James May approaches retirement, he plans to pass the company on to his son, ensuring that Sun's Systems continues to serve its community with dedication and quality. This transition will allow the company to maintain its commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction.

## Brief History of Company

Since its establishment in the 1990s, Sun's Systems has operated with a largely manual system. The company relies on text-based documents and basic spreadsheet programs to track customer orders and inventory of parts. This traditional approach has served the company well in its early years.
With the emergence of the Internet, Sun's Systems has experienced increased customer traffic, driven by positive recommendations for its products and services. However, this surge in popularity has presented new challenges. Managing data and information manually has become increasingly difficult, leading to issues such as lost records, delays in order processing, and the need for frequent rewriting of information. These inefficiencies have become more pronounced as the business grows, highlighting the inadequacy of the current system for handling the increasing volume of transactions and customer interactions. Consequently, there is a pressing need to transition to a more efficient, automated system to keep pace with the companyâ€™s expansion and to maintain high standards of customer service.

## Limitations with Existing System and Background Information of Proposed System

### Limitations with Existing System

Since its inception, the company has relied on manual processes to manage operations, from tracking stock to handling customer computer parts and services like repairing computers, building new custom computers and making deliveries. This involved using paper-based records and spreadsheet software.

However, with increasing customer feedback, the original system (manual processes and spreadsheets) is becoming obsolete. As the company gains more clients, the shortcomings of Sun's Systems' management system are becoming apparent.

Challenges Faced:

- Inaccuracies in data
- Data loss
- Time-consuming processes
- Redundancy
- Delays
- Goals of the New System

### Background Information of Proposed System

The new system aims to improve the system by using:

1. Centralized Database:

	- Store and structure data in a single location (computer/server)
	- Reduce/eliminate the risk of data loss and inconsistencies
	- Include backup functionalities

2. Automated Entries:

	- Minimize time spent on data entry
	- Enhance accuracy

By transitioning to a modern, automated database system, Sun's Systems will be well-equipped to handle its growing customer base and operational demands. The new system will not only address current challenges but also pave the way for future success by enhancing data management, operational efficiency, and customer experience.
