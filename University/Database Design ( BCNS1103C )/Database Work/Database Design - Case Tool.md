# CASE Tools

>[!tip] Broad Definition
>Computer Aided Software Engineering ( CASE ) Tools are computers ( software ) tools / methods that facilitates the creation of ( *other* ) softwares.

>[!tip] Database Design Definition
>Computer Aided Software Engineering ( CASE ) Tools helps to automate various aspect of database development process from initial [[Data Modelling - Conceptual - Logical Level Modelling | Conceptual Models]] to [[ANSI - SPARC Model#Internal Level / Physical Level | Physical]] database implementation and maintenance.

# Types of CASE Tools

- Diagramming Tools
	- Creating Graphics / Graphical Representation of System
		- Creating of Flow-Charts, [[Entity Relationship Diagram ( ERD ) and Relationships#What is an Entity Relationship Diagram? | Entity Relationship Diagram]]
- Computer Display and Report Generators
	- These tools helps to understand the **Data Requirements** and **Relationship Involved**
- Analysis Tools
	- Checks for inconsistencies, incorrect specifications involved in the **diagram** and **data flow**
	- Helps to collect *Data Requirements*
- Central Repository ( *Version Control* )
	- Single point of **Storage** for *Data Diagrams*, *Reports*, *Documents* related to the Project
	- Git / GitHub
- Tools for Database Management $\leftarrow$ *The one that we are specially interested in*
	- Facilitate the *Construction*, *Design* and *[[Database Administrator | Administration]]*
- Tools for Documentation
	- Makes the process of *Creating*, *Organising* and *Maintaining* project **documentation** easier

# Examples of CASE Tools

## Diagramming CASE Tools Examples

### Old Diagramming Softwares

1. ERwin Data Modeler
	- Supports Conceptual, Logical and Physical data modelling
2. IBM Rational Rose
	- Support for [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) diagrams
		- Class Diagrams, Case Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams
3. Oracle Designer
	- Support for Data and Process Modelling, Generation of [[ANSI - SPARC Model#"Levels" | Database Schemas]] and Application Code

### New Diagramming Softwares

1. Lucidchart
	- Real time collaborative creation of diagrams
	- ERDs, Flow-Charts and UML Diagrams
2. Draw.io
	- Open-Source / FOSS
	- Integration with Google Drive, [GitHub](https://www.github.com/Sunhaloo)
	- ERDs, Flow-Chart, Network Diagrams ( *and more* )
3. Microsoft Visio
	- Again similar to the others
	- Provides collaboration features
	- ERDs, Flow-Charts, UML, Network Diagrams
4. Astah
	- Easy to use / User-Friendly
	- Desktop ( *local* ) and Cloud Based
	- ERDs, Flow-Charts, UML Diagrams
