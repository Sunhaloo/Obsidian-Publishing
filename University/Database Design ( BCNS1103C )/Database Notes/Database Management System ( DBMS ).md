# Database Management System ( DBMS )

>[!tip]- Definition
>It is the software package used to **create** and **maintain** computerised *databases*.

## Advantages of DBMS

- [[Database Administrator | DBA]] $=$ focus of centralised control
- No / Reduction of Redundancies / Duplication
	- Data is **normalised** to minimised data redundancy
	- Avoids unnecessary duplication $\Rightarrow$ Storage space is saved.
- Sharing of Data
- Data Integrity
	- [[Microsoft Access ( 2007 )#Validation in MS Access | Validation]] Checks
- Security
	- Authorisation + Access Control
	- Backups + Recovery

## Disadvantages of DBMS

- Cost
	- Hardware + Software
- Complexity
- Database Failure

## Functions of DBMS

- Storage, Retrieval and Update
- Sharing of Data
- Backups + Recovery
- Data Dictionary
	- Creation + Maintenance
	- Metadata
- Transaction Support
	- SQL Command: `ROLLBACK` $\leftarrow$ if some interruption in the middle of transaction occur
- Security: Authorisation + Access Control
- Integrity Preservation
- Utility Services like:
	- Data Conversions
	- Metrics
	- Garbage Collection

>[!info] Data Dictionary and Garbage Collection
>What is a Data Dictionary?
>- Data Dictionary or *Metadata Repository* is a centralised repository of information about data such as: *meaning*, *origin*, *relationships*, *integrity constraints*
>- Helps manage the database in consistent manner; used in **recovery** and **auditing**
>
>What is Garbage Collection?
>- Form of automatic memory management
>- Process of making space in computer's memory by removing data that is no longer required
