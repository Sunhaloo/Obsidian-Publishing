# What is a Domain and Range of Set?

>[!tip]- Definition
>- All the values that can go into a relation are called **domains** ( *input* )
>- All the values that come out of a relation are called **range** ( *output* )

>[!note]
>The **domain** is the set of all first elements of [[Sets, Functions and Relations#Cartesian Product | ordered pairs]] ( *$x$-coordinates* )
>The **range** is the set of all second elements of ordered pairs ( *$y$-coordinates* )

## Examples: Ordered Pairs ( Domain and Range )

![[Relations - Domain and Range Drawing.png | 500]]

#### Example 1: Simple Exercise

State the Domain and Range of the following relation; $R = \{ (1, 3), (-2, 7), (-3, 3), (4, 5), (1, -3) \}$

$Domain \ = \ \{ 1, -2, 3, 4 \} \Rightarrow$ The $x$-coordinates of the ordered pair
$Range \ = \ \{ -3, 3, 5, 7 \} \Rightarrow$ The $y$-coordinates of the ordered pair

>The *Range* has been **sorted** in *ascending* order.

#### Example 2: With and *Equation* in Relation

Let $R$ be a relation on $N$ ( *where $N$ is the Set of Natural Numbers; i.e $\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... \}$* ) defined by

$$R = \{ (x, y) : x + 2y = 14 \}$$

In this case, we have $(x, y)$; meaning that all of our $x$ values will be the **Domain** while all of our $y$ values will be our **Range**.
If you followed well, you will remember that we said:

>Domain = INPUT
>Range = OUTPUT

Hence, we need to make $y$ the Subject of Formula! Which means we get

##### Steps:

1. Make sure that our Domain and Range ( *of our equation* ) corresponds to the relation given $\uparrow$.

$$y = \frac{14 - x}{2}$$

2. Find the [[Sets, Functions and Relations#Cartesian Product | Ordered Pair]] by testing ( *input* ) values into the equation

>[!warning]
>Because we have a condition and that condition is $N$
>This means that we only need to take **Natural Numbers** as our *output*!

If $x = 1$, $y = \frac{13}{2} \Rightarrow$ **Reject** $\rightarrow$ Not part of *Natural Numbers*!
If $x = 2$, $y = 6$
If $x = 4$, $y = 5$
If $x = 6$, $y = 4$
If $x = 8$, $y = 3$
If $x = 10$, $y = 2$
If $x = 12$, $y = 1$
If $x = 14$, $y = 0$ **Reject** $\rightarrow$ Not part of *Natural Numbers*!

>We stopped at 0 because from $0$ to $-\infty$

4. Write the Ordered Pairs

Therefore our answer will be:

>[!bug] Ask Chacha!

$R = \{ (2, 6), (4, 5), (6, 4), (8, 3), (10, 2), (12, 1) \}$

5. Write down the Domain and Range

$Domain \ = \ \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 \}$
$Range \ = \ \{6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 \}$

##### Write the **Inverse** of the above $\uparrow$ relation

Simply inverse the order of the values inside the brackets!

$\Rightarrow  R = \{ (6, 2), (5, 4), (4, 6), (3, 8), (2, 10), (1, 12) \} \leftarrow$
