# What is a Module?

In simple terms, there are the normal python files ( `.py` ); these python files contains codes that can be imported inside another Python Program ( "*I consider them a bit like a dependency*" ).

## Built-In Modules

These are files that are already present upon the installation of Python.
There are many built-in functions in Python. To see all the available modules in Python, type the following in the Python shell or using Terminal ( Python in the terminal directly )

```python

# List of Modules Available
help('modules')

```

## Installing Other Modules

We can even install other modules that does not come pre-installed when installing Python!

In some cases, it is required to install some modules as different OS, does not install everything.

I remember that Linux comes pre-installed with the **curses** module whereas in Windows. You have to manually install it.

### How to Install Modules

### PIP

Think of this like our package manager ( *similar to `apt` or `scoop` or `pacman`* ). This will allow us to install various modules.

>[!note]
>If you have Python Version 3.4 or $\gt$; then you do not need to worry as PIP is installed by default.

>[!tip] Usage
>To download some modules / *package*, use the command / template below $\downarrow$:
>```console
>python -m pip install insert_package_name_here
>```
