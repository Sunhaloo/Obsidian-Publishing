# What are `structs`?

Structures or `structs` ( *for short* ) are; from what I understand it is **similar** to [[Object Oriented Programming - Python | OOP]] ( *but its not actually classes / OOP* ).

>Because as you might know; its that [[C Language | C]] is **only** a *procedural* language and does not provide any support for Classes and Methods.
>>*Not really, its just does **not** have any methods and is very similar to Classes $\rightarrow$ emphasis on SIMILAR*
>
>Hence, what is why we use C++ to be able to get classes and methods!

>[!tip]- Definition from ChatGPT:
>It is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together different variables under a single name. Each variable within the struct is called a member or field. Structs are used to represent a collection of related data elements, similar to a record in other programming languages.
