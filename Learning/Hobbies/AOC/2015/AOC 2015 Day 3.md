# What is the Problem?

Santa is now going to deliver some presents in an infinite $\infty$ 2-Dimensional grid of house.

>Sounds like a 2D-Array Problem; なるほど

He will start his journey at this starting location which is currently unknown.

He will be using "*Never Eat Sea Weed*" method to find the direction of the houses

- North = `^`
- East = `>`
- South = `v`
- West = `<`

But the elf back at the North Pole has given Santa some shitty directions $\Rightarrow$ Santa is visiting some houses more than once.

# Part 1

## What do we have to find?

We need to find, **how many houses has received more than one present**?

Given the that input of the file looks like this:

<p align="center">Text File</p>

```
<v<^<<<^>^>>v<^>>vv>^v^^^v<>v<>><>^vv^>vv^...
```

### Thinking Part 1

#### What The Fuck Are These Examples?

For example:

I understood those 2, but the last one...
- `>` delivers presents to `2` houses: one at the starting location, and one to the east.
- `^>v<` delivers presents to `4` houses in a square, including twice to the house at his starting/ending location.
The fuck is this.
- `^v^v^v^v^v` delivers a bunch of presents to some very lucky children at only `2` houses.

I get the last one; so he only goes to 2 houses; meaning at his starting point and at some random house. As you know; he will also deliver a present at his **starting location**. This means that the house at the start point will get 1 more **extra** present.

So... we need to at least read the file and see if everything works fine.
