# How to switch Branches

To be able to switch branches. We need to find out if / whether the repository has other branches except from `main` / `master`.

We are going to run the command below $\downarrow$ to check if the repo has any other branches.

```bash

git branch -a

```

Switching to another branch

```bash

git checkout branch_name

```
