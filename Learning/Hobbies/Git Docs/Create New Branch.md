## Resource

I got this tutorial / documentation from [here](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) $\leftarrow$

>[!warning]
>Before we do anything, we need to make sure that our local repository is *clean*. This is done using the `git pull` command that will *synchronise* our local repo to the remote repo.

# Create New Branch on Local Repository

To create the new **branch**, use the following command below:

```console

git checkout -b new_branch_name

```

## Push *that* New Branch to GitHub

```console

git push origin new_branch_name

```

# See all Branches Created

To check / see all the branches in your repository, simply use the command below:

```console

git branch -a

```

# Add New Remote for Branch

```console

git remote add remote_name new_branch_name

```
