## What are Dotfiles?

These are files / folders that start with the character `.`; and they are hidden **configuration** files that lives in your home directory ( *especially in Linux $\rightarrow$ `.zshrc`, `.tmux.conf` and more* )

### Advantages of Dotfiles

The main advantage is that switching devices does not become a massive pain.

Software Engineers work with different devices across different locations. Each engineer has its own preferences about how to configure their setup for the optimum performance in their workflow.

Thus, these *pre-written* **configuration** files written by *that* programmer / engineer can use the same **setup** across these multiple devices just by cloning their `dotfiles` repository which they post on github.

Examples:

1. This is **devaslife** dotfiles: https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public

2. I have a weird keymap setup that I use for Neovim. Where I press `Ctrl` + the default movement keys to move the caret in *insert mode*. I cannot live without this.

Other Advantages Includes:

- Shareable Configurations
- Increased Productivity
- Backup Of Settings / Configurations
