# Differentiate between Software and Software Engineering

## Software

A software can be a program or combination of programs, algorithms or even pieces of code that perform a specific task.
They are intangible compared to hardware.
There are 2 main types of Softwares:

- System Softwares
- Application Softwares

**System** Softwares can be said to be software that interacts directly to the hardware of the computer system.
Operating Systems is a great example of a System Software
**Application** Softwares can be off-the-shelf or bespoke softwares. The normally run on top of the *System* Software. They includes software like:

- Word Processing Softwares
- Integrated Development Environment
- Web Browsers

## Software Engineering

It is the practice or discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
It is the practice of creating, testing and maintaining software or algorithms.
They conforms to rules and regulations which was set out by governing bodies.
They use systematic approach and frameworks to develop high quality softwares.

Example of Software Engineering / Work:

- Web Developer
- App Developer

# What is the role of Software Engineers in Society?

To design, develop and maintain systems / softwares that affect everyday lives.
They are needed to help maintain systems / infrastructure like hospitals, banks, government bodies.
They also make / must their systems easy to use as not everyone is computer-savvy

# What are the main differences between generic products and bespoke systems?

## Generic Products

They are off-the-shelf products that are readily available and can easily be used by everyone and anyone.
They are normally cheaper and designed for the most popular systems.

Example:

- Office Suites
- Web Browsers
- Video Games

## Bespoke Systems / Softwares

These softwares are built / coded to meet user's / customer's specific needs and requirements. Depending on the complexity; it can easily become very expensive. They might be designed to only work on a specific system.

Example:

- Bash Scripts
- Specific Company related Softwares

# What is it important to have a disciplined approach to software engineering?

To conform to the rules and regulations set out by the upper governing bodies.
This ensures that no violations such as privacy violations are made.
It also ensures that the systems / softwares being created are error free as they have been thoroughly tested before releasing.

# What are the differences between software and hardware engineering?

Hardware Engineerings are responsible to design and create hardware / Integrated Circuits / Chips. These can include motherboard, specialised circuit boards for washing machines.

Software Engineers are responsible to create softwares / systems that will work and interact with the hardware / boards / circuits that these hardware engineers created.

# Why is it challenging to produce high-quality software?

Because of the specific requirements of user(s); it becomes difficult to please everyone in the society.
In addition, complex programs are difficult to create as it requires many resources like time, money and brain power.

# What are the ethical principles that software engineers should adhere to?

First of all they should all conform to the IEEE Code of Ethics; whereby they say that one should:

- Avoid biases
- Have professional judgement
- Act in the interest of the client
- Should keep in mind of data security

# What is the role of software metrics in software engineering?

Software Metrics are used to check if the software ( created ) is doing fine in terms of customer usage, customer engagement, reports.
Hence, the software engineers can see what they are lacking and can fix problems so that it can bring new users and retain old users.

# What are some common reasons for software project failures?

1. Lack of Management
2. Failure to conform to Rules and Regulations
3. Ever changing Requirements
4. Lack of Resources
5. Poor Documentation

# How do economic factors influence software engineering?

Most importantly; money and time. They play a big role in influencing Software Engineering.
For example: If your software / product cost a lot compared to the average salary of someone in your country; then no one is going to buy that software even though it might be a good product.
