# Bit Permutations

We know that binary numeral system is a $base \ 2$ system. This means that we only have 2 values instead of our lovely $\base \ 10$ "*human*" system ( *just get on with it* ). The values for binary numeral system are either `0` and `1`.

## What the Heck is Bit Permutations.

Think of it like various possibilities.

So for example, we can take 1 bit. As you know the possible values for 1 bit are, again, `0` and `1`.
Another example we can take is 2 bits; now we are going to get 4 possible **combinations**.

Hence, we can develop this formula: $2^{N} \ \rightarrow$ where `N` is the number of bits in the "*string of bits*"

# Concreate Example

I know, you might not have understood anything from the above $\uparrow$ notes. So here are some actual work examples.

>Big-ass table incoming

| 1 Bit | 2 Bit | 3 Bit | 4 Bit |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 | 00 | 000 | 0000 |
| 1 | 01 | 001 | 0001 |
| | 10 | 010 | 0010 |
| | 11 | 100 | 0011 |
| | | 011 | 0100 |
| | | 101 | 0101 |
| | | 110 | 0110 |
| | | 111 | 0111 |
| | | | 1000 |
| | | | 1001 |
| | | | 1010 |
| | | | 1011 |
| | | | 1100 |
| | | | 1101 |
| | | | 1110 |
| | | | 1111 |

As you can see:

| 1 Bit | 2 Bit | 3 Bit | 4 Bit |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2 Possibilities | 4 Possibilities | 8 Possibilities | 16 Possibilities |

Hence, we can see that if follow the rule / formula: $2^{N}$

Lets take another example: What is you have 64 Bits?

Then you would get $2^{64}$ Possibilities
