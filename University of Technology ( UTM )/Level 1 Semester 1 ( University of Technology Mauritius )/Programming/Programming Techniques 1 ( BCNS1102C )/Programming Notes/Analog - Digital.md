# Analog

## What is Analog Data?

>[!tip]- Definition
>Data is **continuous**, in direct proportional to the data represented

Data is represented in a *physical* way.

- Examples:
	- Sound Waves
	- Vinyl Record
	- Disturbance in Water / Fluid

Basically Sine Curves $\downarrow$:

# Digital / Discrete

## What is Digital Data?

>[!tip]- Definition
>Information is represented as a string of discrete symbols; each piece of data / symbol is represented separately

![[Digital - Square Wave.png | 550]]

Computers only understand **digital** data; this means that for a computer to understand *analog* data, the data needs to be **converted** so that the computer can understand.

# Converting Analog and Digital Data

>Remember in O-Level and A-Level, we used to describe how Sensors worked. Remember `ADC` and `DAC`... eh, eh, eh... remember.
>If you don't, no wo... you fool, how can you forget this mf.

## Analog $\rightarrow$ Digital

- Analog ( *continuous* ) data is captured by a device ( *like a microphone / sensor* )
- The **Analog to Digital** ( ADC ) converter will convert the "*waves*" / analog data into a format that the computer can understand
- CPU / Processor receives the converted data...
- Data is manipulated

## Digital $\rightarrow$ Analog

>Could say a continuation from above $\uparrow$

- After data is manipulated by the computer / user
- CPU / Processor will sent the data to
- The **Digital to Analog** ( DAC ) converter will convert the discrete ( *1 or 0* ) data in analog data / continuous data.
- Then devices ( *like speakers / sensors* ) can output it so that it can be heard or can manipulate an actuator
